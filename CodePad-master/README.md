CodePad
=======

  CodePad is a light-weight tabbed text editor with many features built on top of Python. It is built using Tkinter (yes, so
that it is ACTUALLY lightweight ;) ) and ttk. I built this so that I would have a good, easily modifiable, light text 
editor that I could use anywhere without worrying too much about installation or consuming too many resources (I work
in environments where it is nice to have an editor, but resources are somewhat scarce). I will be adding features to this as
I go, but please feel free to submit bug reports and leave suggestions. I would be excited if someone adopted this as their
own workhorse. :)


#### Requirements:
  
  * Tkinter (for GUI)
  * Ttk (for GUI)
  * Pygments (for Syntax highlighting)
