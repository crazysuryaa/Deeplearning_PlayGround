# Deeplearning_PlayGround
 OpenSource drag and drop GUI Alternative for Script Based Deeplearning Model Creation 

   <br>Deep learning is one of the enormously growing fields. The way we try to mimic the brain's neurons with mathematics and their implementation using code is really great work.
   Frameworks like TensorFlow, Keras, and PyTorch have simplified it even further by doing all the math of neural networks for us and leaving us a highly flexible ecosystem of ML tools. The way they utilized graphs as their basic structure and gradients to update and optimize the nodes of graphs is a clever piece of work.
   
   <br><br>However, I have always believed that learning and understanding how brain neural networks work, as well as creating graphs that mimic neurons, is a better way to begin deep learning, particularly for those who believe language is a barrier.
   My project is to create an open-source graphical framework for creating brain-like graphs while also learning to code.
   <br><br>
   In my free time, I created a GUI based on the TensorFlow functional API. In traditional frameworks, we write code that creates a graph in the backend, and then we use the loss functions of optimizers to update the graph. And finally, we can use tools like plot model or tensor board to understand what the graph looks like. In a slightly different way, deep playground uses a GUI where you can drag and drop different layers to build a graph, add some optimizers or loss functions, which can then be compiled and trained like regular TensorFlow models.
    It generates the equivalent scripts for both building the model and transferring and loading the created model to other systems or even the cloud.
   This makes more sense when we try to implement some large networks just by looking at their architecture.
   Right now, I've just implemented a few of the most frequently used layers.
